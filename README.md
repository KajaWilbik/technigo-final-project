# Final Project
We are creating a party planner app (kids & grownups) with React Native that will be available in Google Play Store. Users will log in to their own account and then be able to browse inspiration and id√©es for themes, activities, food, drinks, and decorations. You will be able to choose if you want to plan a kid's party or a grownup party. 

User will be able to save projects/parties to their profile with a project board and make a guest list and check off tasks that she/he have done. User will be able to add estimated costs for each part and the total estimated budget for their parties. 

We will build a database with the different categories to browse.

Problems: 
-
-
-
-
- Android version crashed few days before hand-in, did not work on emulator, not on android device

Our approach:
-
-
-
-
- Android problem troubleshooting: We decided to come back to moment when everything was working, and check one by one, what is the feature that crashed the app. First of all we created a new app to check if it is not a problem with expo, new app worked without issue. Next we went to uppdates in app.json because we changed expo icon to our own, that was not an issue either. The third check was lottie animation in background in the app, which end up being an issue for android. After changing it back to picture, everything started working again.
