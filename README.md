# Final Project
We are creating a party planner app (kids & grownups) with React Native that will be available in Google Play Store. Users will log in to their own account and then be able to browse inspiration and id√©es for themes, activities, food, drinks, and decorations. You will be able to choose if you want to plan a kid's party or a grownup party. 

User will be able to save projects/parties to their profile with a project board and make a guest list and check off tasks that she/he have done. User will be able to add estimated costs for each part and the total estimated budget for their parties. 

We will build a database with the different categories to browse.
